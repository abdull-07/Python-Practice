# Python Practice

A collection of small Python practice exercises and mini-projects organized by difficulty and topic. These files are intended for beginners and intermediate learners to practice core Python concepts like control flow, loops, data structures, and simple application logic.

**Structure**
- **`1.py`**: Misc single-file examples.
- **`BONUS Mini Projects/`**: Small standalone projects (e.g., Number Guessing Game, Password Checker, Todo app).
- **`Functions/`**: `functions.py` containing helper functions used across exercises.
- **`Level 1 Basic Python Practice (Warm-up)/`**: Simple beginner exercises (greeting, number checks, simple calculator, etc.).
- **`Level 2 — Loops Practice/`**: Exercises focused on loops (tables, sums, reversing numbers, patterns, etc.).
- **`Level 3 — Data Structures Practice/`**: Lists and string manipulation exercises.
- **`Level 4 — Logic & Challenge Questions/`**: Slightly harder problems (palindrome, merge lists, second largest number, etc.).

**Getting Started**
- **Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+ installed.
- **Run an exercise:** Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```
python path\\to\\exercise.py
